Hello! I'm excited to help you convert these mathematical equations into C# code. While C# is a powerful language capable of handling many mathematical and scientific computations, some of these models may benefit from specialized libraries for efficiency and advanced functionalities. Libraries such as Math.NET Numerics can be particularly useful for numerical computations, linear algebra, and more.
Below are C# implementations for the equations you've provided. Where necessary, I've indicated the use of specialized libraries.

            this.rows = rows;
            this.cols = cols;
            this.criticalThreshold = criticalThreshold;
            grid = new int[rows, cols];
        }

        public void AddGrain(int x, int y)
        {
            grid[x, y]++;
            Topple();

                        {
                            grid[i, j] -= 4;
                            // Topple to neighbors
                            if (i > 0) grid[i - 1, j]++;
                            if (i < rows - 1) grid[i + 1, j]++;
                            if (j > 0) grid[i, j - 1]++;
                            if (j < cols - 1) grid[i, j + 1]++;
                            hasToppled = true;
                        }
                    }

Explanation:
This implementation models the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld (BTW) Sandpile Model.
Grains are added to specific sites, and when a site's grain count exceeds the critical threshold, it topples, distributing grains to its neighbors.
The Topple method ensures the system reaches a stable state.
